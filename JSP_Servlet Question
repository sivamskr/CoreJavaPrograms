How do you define application wide error page in JSP?

You can define two kinds of error pages in Java web application, 
>  one is using tag <error-page> in web.xml 
>  other is by using error page JSP which uses isErrorpage to declare that this jsp page can be used as error page.
Other JSP uses that page by using attribute errorpage="error.jsp". Whenever you get an unhandled exception in JSP, request will be routed to error page.
