Difference between == and equals() method 

Difference between equals() and hashCode()


class loader is responsible to load that class file from file system,network or any other location. This class loader is nothing but also a class from which location they are loading the class according to that class loaders are three types :

1.Bootstrap  
2.Extension  
3.System class loader

String

String vs StringBuffer, 
-String object is immutable
-StringBuffer/StringBuilder objects are mutable

Comparator and Comparable in Java



SimpleDateFormat is used to convert Dates to String and vice-versa.
  SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy/MM/DD HH:mm:ss");
  Date curdate= new Date();
  System.out.println(sdf.format(curdate));


Collections 
- iterable interface present in java.lang package not in java.util package 

    Set(no duplicates) ::  Queue   :: List(inseration order)     ::   Map(key value pair)

                      add()                                               put()
    HashSet                           ArrayList                       HashMap  
    TreeSet                           Linked List                     TreeMap
                                      Vector                          Hashtable


  import java.util.Hashtable;
  import java.util.Iterator;
  import java.util.Map;
  import java.util.Map.Entry;
  import java.util.Set;
  
  Iterator<Entry<Integer, String>> i= stockSet.iterator();
  System.out.println("Iterating over Hashtable in Java");
  
  //Iterator begins
  while(i.hasNext()){
    Map.Entry<Integer,String> m=i.next();
    int key = m.getKey();
    String value=m.getValue();
    System.out.println("Key :"+key+"  value :"+value);
  }



ArrayList and HashSet 
- index based  use get(index) and remove(index)
- object based. HashSet also doesn't provide get() method


ArrayList vs LinkedList
- ArrayList is backed by Array while LinkedList is backed by LinkedList
- ArrayList is better choice than LinkedList in almost all cases, except when you do a frequent add() operation than remove() or get().


ArrayList vs Vector

HashMap vs Hashtable

To use any object as key in HashMap , it needs to implement equals() and hashCode() method .


Threads






Streams
  byte stream :  For reading and writing binary data


  Character streams : work with the characters 

Design Pattern

Double checked locking in Singleton
private DCL dcl = null; 
 public DCL getDCL() {
      if (dcl == null) {    #insted of creating an object directly we double check to create an instance
      synchronized { 
         if (dcl == null) 
            dcl = new DCL(); 
       } 
     }
