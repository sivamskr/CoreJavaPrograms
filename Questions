import java.util.Hashtable;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Map.Entry;
import java.util.Set;

Iterator<Entry<Integer, String>> i= stockSet.iterator();
System.out.println("Iterating over Hashtable in Java");

//Iterator begins
while(i.hasNext()){
  Map.Entry<Integer,String> m=i.next();
  int key = m.getKey();
  String value=m.getValue();
  System.out.println("Key :"+key+"  value :"+value);
}
