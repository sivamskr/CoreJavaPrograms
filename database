In MySQL, physically, a schema is synonymous with a database. You can substitute the keyword SCHEMA instead of DATABASE in MySQL SQL syntax, for example using CREATE SCHEMA instead of CREATE DATABASE.

Some other database products draw a distinction. For example, in the Oracle Database product, a schema represents only a part of a database: the tables and other objects owned by a single user


create schema advpy


>>>> Switching to a Different Schema(Oracle) <<< 
The following statement sets the schema of the current session to the schema name specified in the statement.
ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA = <schema name>


CREATE TABLE `advpy`.`New Table` (
  `username` INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `password` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`username`)
)
ENGINE = InnoDB;
