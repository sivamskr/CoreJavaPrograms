In MySQL, physically, a schema is synonymous with a database. You can substitute the keyword SCHEMA instead of DATABASE in MySQL SQL syntax, for example using CREATE SCHEMA instead of CREATE DATABASE.

Some other database products draw a distinction. For example, in the Oracle Database product, a schema represents only a part of a database: the tables and other objects owned by a single user


create schema advpy


>>>> Switching to a Different Schema(Oracle) <<< 
The following statement sets the schema of the current session to the schema name specified in the statement.
ALTER SESSION SET CURRENT_SCHEMA = <schema name>


CREATE TABLE `advpy`.`New Table` (
  `username` INTEGER UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `password` VARCHAR(45) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`username`)
)
ENGINE = InnoDB;



DDL is Data Definition Language statements. 
> CREATE - to create objects in the database 
> ALTER - alters the structure of the database 
> DROP - delete objects from the database  
> TRUNCATE - remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed
> COMMENT - add comments to the data dictionary 

DML is Data Manipulation Language statements. 
> SELECT - retrieve data from the a database 
> INSERT - insert data into a table 
> UPDATE - updates existing data within a table 
> DELETE - deletes all records from a table, the space for the records remain 

DCL is Data Control Language. DCL is used to create roles, grant and revoke permissions, 
establish referential integrity etc.
> GRANT - gives user's access privileges to database 
> REVOKE - withdraw access privileges given with the GRANT command 

TCL: TCL stands for Transactional Control Language. TCL is used to manage transactions within a database.
> COMMIT
> ROLLBACK
